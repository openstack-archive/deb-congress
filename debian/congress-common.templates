_Description: Set up a database for Congress?
 No database has been set up for congress to use. Before
 continuing, you should make sure you have the following information:
 .
  * the type of database that you want to use;
  * the database server hostname (that server must allow TCP connections from this
    machine);
  * a username and password to access the database.
 .
 If some of these requirements are missing, do not choose this option and run with
 regular SQLite support.
 .
 You can change this setting later on by running "dpkg-reconfigure -plow
 congress-common".
