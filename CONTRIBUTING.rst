Contributing
============

The Congress wiki page is the authoritative starting point.

   https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Congress

If you would like to contribute to the development of any OpenStack
project including Congress,
you must follow the steps in this page:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/congress
