Steps to install this policy extension:
1. Install congress client on nova controllers
2. Install (copy) policy module (congress.py) under nova/api
3. In api-paste.ini, declare congress filter and insert it to the execution flow.
   Congress filter usually sits in between the final application 'osapi_compute_app_v2' and keystone context.
   For example, congress filter can be declared as
    "
    [filter:congress]
    paste.filter_factory = nova.api.congress:Congress.factory
    "
    And insert congress into the execution flow like
    "
    keystone_nolimit = compute_req_id faultwrap sizelimit authtoken keystonecontext congress osapi_compute_app_v2
    "
4. Push policies into congress server as indicated in "sample_policies"

P.S. This policy enforcement is supposed to go with admin credentials in order to have a whole picture at domain level.
     Therefore we turn on "all_tenent" option while looking up resource usage across the entire domain.
